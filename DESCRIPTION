Description: Ordinal forests (OF) are a method for ordinal regression with high-dimensional 
  and low-dimensional data that is able to predict the values of the ordinal target variable 
  for new observations and at the same time estimate the relative widths of the classes of 
  the ordinal target variable. Using a (permutation-based) variable importance measure it 
  is moreover possible to rank the importances of the covariates.
  OF will be presented in an upcoming technical report by Hornung et al..
  The main functions of the package are: ordfor() (construction of OF), predict.ordfor() 
  (prediction of the target variable values of new observations), and plot.ordfor() 
  (visualization of the estimated relative widths of the classes of the ordinal target 
  variable).
